Kmenuedit is a program to manage a directory hierarchy of kdelnk-files. Currently
these directories are $HOME/Personal and $KDEDIR/apps.

The idea behind this program is the following: The menus for $KDEDIR/apps used in 
kpanel and ktaskbar might get quite large and I don't want to move through the whole
hierarchy every time I want to execute a program. So I'd like to put often used 
entries in my $HOME/Personal folder. This is possible with kfm, too, but it is 
not very handy and not obvious to the average user.

With this program I think it is quite easy to build your own personal menu in kpanel
and ktaskbar.

This is the first version, so many things are still missing.

You will need libqt-1.2, libkde-970806 (with the new KIconLoader).

Features:
	- drag and drop between menus
	- drop of kdelnk-files from kfm onto a menu
	- cut, copy and paste of menu entries
	- editing of kdelnk-file
	- you may edit $KDEDIR/apps if you have sufficient permissions

Bugs:
	- don't drop a menu entry on a kvt window, the kvt will dump core
	  (Well I think this is a bug of kvt ;-) )

TODO:
	- a lot of things, but tell me your suggestions

Install:
	see INSTALL for details
