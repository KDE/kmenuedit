Hi !

I have just uploaded a new version of kmenuedit to ftp.kde.org.
I think it will move to /pub/kde/unstable/apps/utils.


What is kmenuedit
-----------------

Kmenuedit is a program to manage a directory hierarchy of kdelnk-files. Currently
these directories are $HOME/Personal and $KDEDIR/apps.

The idea behind this program is the following: The menus for $KDEDIR/apps used in 
kpanel and ktaskbar might get quite large and I don't want to move through the whole
hierarchy every time I want to execute a program. So I'd like to put often used 
entries in my $HOME/Personal folder. This is possible with kfm, too, but it is 
not very handy and not obvious to the average user.

With this program I think it is quite easy to build your own personal menu in kpanel
and ktaskbar.

This is the first version, so many things are still missing.

(Please note: mini-icons and moving the position of entries inside a menu are not
 supported by kpanel, but this will change soon :-) ).

New in this version
-------------------

- compiles with kdelibs-970806
- uses mimetypes as kfm II does

Regards.
