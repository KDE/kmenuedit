Hi !

KMenuedit is now part of the KDE base system.


What is kmenuedit
-----------------

Kmenuedit is a program to manage a directory hierarchy of kdelnk-files. Currently
these directories are $HOME/.kde/share/applnk and $KDEDIR/share/applnk.

The idea behind this program is the following: The menus for $KDEDIR/share/applnk used in 
kpanel might get quite large and I don't want to move through the whole
hierarchy every time I want to execute a program. So I'd like to put often used 
entries in my $HOME/.kde/share/applnk folder. This is possible with kfm, too, but it is 
not very handy and not obvious to the average user.

With this program I think it is quite easy to build your own personal menu in kpanel.


New in this version
-------------------

- removed fvwm support
- add swallow kdelnk-files

Regards.
