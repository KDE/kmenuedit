version 0.3.0
- removed fvwm support
- added swallow kdelnk-files
- accepts drops from kfm if the file is a kdelnk-file or an executable
- drags entries onto the desktop or kpanel
- changes kdelnk-files instead of overwriting them

- smaller fixes in pmenu.cpp:
    - introduced real_name and uses this for the sort_order
      to work together with kpanel needs  
    - default icons similar to the filename (a la kpanel) if
      icon/miniicon is not specified

                                                 (Matthias)
